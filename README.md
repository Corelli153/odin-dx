These bindings are generated from the C header files in the Windows Kits SDK.

These are incomplete and untested. If you run into issues, or find things are missing you are free to submit a pull request, or create an issue and I will get to it when I can.

A sample usage of the bindings can be found at: https://github.com/DrProfesor/dxtoy
